# Before updating this....

The point isn't _really_ for these fixtures to validate against a particular
api version. It's to be able to parse the API types no matter what it is.

So you should only ever update this when there is a bug with the libraries
ability to parse a new API's apiSchema.

**Old fixtures may fail, and need fixed, if you update the test apiSchemas**
